# Archived Files

This directory contains files that are no longer actively used in the Hasenpfeffr project but are kept for reference.

## Why Archive?

Files are archived rather than deleted to:
1. Preserve historical code
2. Provide reference for previous implementations
3. Reduce confusion in the main codebase
4. Minimize the risk of accidental modifications to unused files

## Archived Files

| control-panel.js | /Users/wds/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project/ | March 5, 2025 | Duplicate of bin/control-panel.js. The bin version is used in production. |
| fixed-control-panel.js | /Users/wds/CascadeProjects/windsurf-project/ | March 5, 2025 | Development version that was likely created to fix issues. The bin/control-panel.js is now the maintained version. |
