The personalizedGrapeRank scripts calculate personalized GrapeRank scores, personalized to the owner of the Brainstorm instance. Results are stored in NostrUser nodes in neo4j.

Tentative plan for the future (as of 15 July 2025) is to calculate Global GrapeRank and PageRank scores, and store them in NostrUser nodes in neo4j, with owner-specific scores stored in NostrUserWotMetricsCard nodes. An alternative plan would be to calculate and store global as well as owner-specific scores in NostrUser nodes, the rationale being that owner scores will be used more often and may have more paremeters than customers. However, this may bloat the NostrUser nodes with too much data data, and an alternative plan is to have different tiers of customers, with the owner being the highest tier. This would mean that the customer-specific scores, including owner-specific scores, would be stored in NostrUserWotMetricsCard nodes, and the global scores would be stored in NostrUser nodes.

A yet another alternative plan would be to calculate and store all scores, including global scores, in NostrUserWotMetricsCard nodes. This would clear up NostrUser nodes from too much data, although some composite scores, such as blacklist and whitelist, could still be kept in NostrUser nodes if it would improve performance of commonly-used queries.
