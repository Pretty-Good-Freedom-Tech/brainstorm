This file is a modification of the personalizedGrapeRank algorithm. The local graperank calculation scripts are replaced by manime's implementation, imported from the graperank-nodejs repository.

Problems we encountered as of 21 March 2025:
the graperank-nodejs repository requires typescript compilation but lacked the needed infrastructure to do so. Specifically, it requires tsconfig.json files and a package.json file with the correct configuration. To address these issues, a tsconfig.json file and a prepare script were included in the repository root file. Not yet completed but needed: same fixes to Calculator, Interpretor, and Storage subdirectories. Alterative plan: install Calculator but not Interpretor and Storage. Need to figure out the correct URL to do that. Alternatively, we could break the repo into multiple repos.

Long term plan may be to calculate graperank using the local graperank calculation scripts as well as the imported graperank-nodejs repository Calculator, to load results into Neo4j, and to compare results.
