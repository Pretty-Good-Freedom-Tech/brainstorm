# Brainstorm systemd services

Each of the services in this directory is a systemd service file for Brainstorm. Several of them are placed on timers. During brainstorm installation, the services are copied to the appropriate locations. Systemd status can be checked with `sudo systemctl status <service-name>` or at the control panel at: https://your-domain/control/. 

To do: review each service individually.
